<p>Among primitive peoples the calendar, sun worship
and agriculture are closely connected. When man
was just emerging from the hunting or fishing stages
into early agricultural conditions it rarely happened
that he replanted the same fields year after year, for
it was early recognized that the land, however fertile,
would not yield good crops in successive years but
should lie fallow one or more years before replanting.
The primitive agriculturist learned by experience
that a change was necessary to insure good crops.
To effect this change the agriculturist moved his habitation
and planted on the sites where the soil was
found to be fertile. There was thus a continual shifting
of planting places which accounts in part for
frequent migrations. In our Southwest this nomadic
condition was succeeded by a stationary agricultural
stage. Necessary water was supplied by irrigation
which also contributed nourishment necessary for the
enrichment of the soil. When an agricultural population
is thus anchored to one locality, permanent,
well-constructed habitations are built near farms
that are tilled year after year.</p>

<p>The following ideas on the relation of agricultural
people, the calendar and sun worship were practically
adopted from Mr. E. J. Payne’s “History of the New
World called America.”</p>

<p>It is obligatory for the agriculturist, especially when
the country is arid, to have a reliable calendar; he must
know the best time for planting that the seeds may
germinate, the epoch when the rains are most abundant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
that the plants may grow, and the season when
the hot sun may mature the growing corn. Agricultural
life necessitates an exact calendar.</p>

<p>Several methods are used by the primitive agriculturist
to determine the time for planting, the most
reliable of which is the position of the sun and moon
on the horizon rising or setting. The movements of
the latter, especially the phases of the new moon, although
important, do not serve as the best basis of
the annual calendar. The time of the year cannot
be told by observations of the moon. The phases of
the moon play a certain rôle among agricultural
people, since this planet takes a subordinate place in
determining the calendar. The positions of the sun,
or the points of its rising and setting on the horizon
and its altitude at midday, afforded the primitive
agriculturist data that could be relied upon from year
to year to determine the season. The position of the
sun at midsummer and midwinter, rising or setting, is
associated with most important events; the winter
solstice indicates the time when the fields should be
prepared for cultivation; when the irrigating ditches
should be cleared out and prepared for planting.
We consequently find the winter solstice, which occurs
at the close of December, is practically set aside by
all agricultural people as an occasion of a great festival
in which sun-worship is dominant. At this time we
also find a complicated ceremony, the object of which
is to draw back the sun and prepare the people for the
work before them. Around this midwinter festival
were crowded rites of the purification of the earth from
evil influences of winter, a dramatic personation of the
return of the sun god, preliminary to the call to the
husbandman to begin his work. The planting itself
occurs somewhat later, or when the sun reaches the
vernal equinox, the determination of which is less
important than the solstice.</p>

<p>When agricultural man had discovered a reliable
calendar and was able to definitely determine the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
time for planting, growth, and harvesting of his crops,
his life became still more rigidly fixed in sedentary conditions;
he no longer was a hunter or shepherd; he
ceased to have a nomadic tendency. The consciousness
of being able to rely upon a definite food supply
expresses itself in the art of building. He is led to
construct more durable habitations. Successful agriculture,
stable architecture, and a reliable calendar
are thus closely connected. The most successful
agriculture in aboriginal North America is found in
regions where knowledge of the calendar was most
highly developed. Early efforts to perfect the calendar
by studies of the sun intensified sun worship.
The most highly developed expressions of solar worship
as well as the best constructed masonry on the
American continent are associated with the highest
development of the calendar. There can be adduced
no better illustration than the masonry of Peruvian
temples which compares favorably with any in the
world. The surface ornamentation of these buildings
is not as elaborate as in those of Central America, but
there are few examples of masonry in the Old World
with stones more accurately fitted together, the walls
more enduring—a remarkable fact when we consider
that the people who built these colossal structures
in the New World were unfamiliar with the
metals, iron and steel. Sun worship is the basis of
the ancient Peruvian culture expressed by these extraordinary
buildings. Although our knowledge of Peruvian
calendric signs is not as accurate as of that of
Central America, all evidence goes to show that the
calendar of the Incas was not inferior to that of
the Mayas.</p>

<p>In prehistoric North America we find remains of
buildings constructed of masonry quite equal to that
of the same epoch in the Old World. This may be
illustrated by reference to the cliff-dwellers’ towers in
our Southwest. If some of the towers of Sardinia
were placed side by side with those of southwestern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
Colorado, any impartial observer would say that the
masonry in the latter was equal to that in the former.
The megalithic dolmens of England exhibit no walls
superior in masonry to massive walls in the mountain
canyons of Utah and Arizona constructed before the
advent of the whites. In other words it is evident
that the architecture of a people is not wholly an index
of stage of culture. If the prehistoric aborigines
of our Southwest be judged by buildings we may say
they had progressed in historic development into a
stage attained by nations more advanced because
they were acquainted with metals.</p>

<p>The prehistoric people of our Southwest called pueblos
and cliff-dwellers constructed many different
forms of rooms which can be compared and reduced
to a few types. It is the object of the following pages
to examine the morphology of these buildings.</p>

<p>It will be found on examination that these prehistoric
buildings were constructed on certain universal
lines, reproducing with startling similarity types
which are world-wide. It will also be found that
habitations or buildings devoted to certain utilitarian
purposes have one form, while sacred buildings have
another, following a law geographically widespread.
Man shares with the animal a desire for protection
for his family or food accumulated or awaiting consumption.
This holds true among agricultural peoples
whose food is cereal and can be stored indefinitely
or prepared for use when necessary. It is not necessary
to suppose that man learned the habit of storing
food from bees and squirrels; the same needs produced
the same habits. The earliest storage places adopted
by man were caves, trunks of trees or pits dug in the
earth, the first mentioned being the most common.
The first step taken to improve this storage place was
the construction of a wall to close the entrance to the
cave or pit. A further modification, practically an
expansion of this simple idea, led to the construction
of an elaborate dwelling having rooms specialized for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
different economical purposes within the shelter of the
cave.</p>

<p>This same idea of protection led to another line of
development in which the cave is wanting. The construction
of a stone cairn in the open would also serve
for protection of the food supply. Such a building,
erected simply for storage, naturally drew about it
subordinate rooms for dwellings, at first temporary in
structure but later, as ability in stone-working improved,
permanent buildings or community-houses of
durable material. This second type of prehistoric
building, erected independent of caves, evolved along
lines different from the first; in forms of construction
the two types are similar, but they differ as to sites;
one became a cliff or cave dwelling; the other, what is
called a village or pueblo.</p>

<p>Consider another line of development. The buildings
we have already considered were erected primarily
for the preservation and protection of material possessions.
Man, in whatever stage, regards it as necessary
to construct a building for religious purposes;
in many instances this structure is nothing more than
a row of upright stones enclosing an area devoted to
his gods. No roof was considered necessary since the
objects of worship were practically forces of nature.
As time went on, priests or congregations gathered to
perform rites within the circular or other areas, or in
their neighborhood. These ceremonies rendered secrecy
necessary. A priesthood developed with a
systematic ritual, which had to be hidden from the
eyes of the inquisitive by roofs and side walls,
thus forming a building, from which developed the
temple or sacred room. Subsequently other buildings
were annexed for habitations of priests or laymen.
A condition of this kind occurs in our prehistoric
Southwestern architecture. The sanctuary in this
region is a well-constructed circular building, of peculiar
type. It was not a dwelling but a place of ceremonious
worship. Habitations distinct from these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
ceremonial rooms had walls so perishable that traces
of them are hard to find, the sanctuary walls alone
remaining as an indication of the building art of that
period. A more advanced stage along this line of
evolution was the addition of rooms with permanent
walls to the base of the sanctuary, by which a union
of two different kinds of buildings, sacred and secular,
was brought about. These three lines of architectural
development in our prehistoric Southwest verged
in a parallel development into the same form, all
starting from the rudest structure and culminating in
an almost identical type, one the cave habitation, the
other the storage room with its annex, and the third
the sacred building or sanctuary, around which are
clustered rooms for secular purposes. A combination
of the three types, producing a composite cluster,
gives us what is called the terraced community house
or pueblo.</p>

<p>The term “pueblo,” signifying a village or town,
was applied by Spanish explorers to Indian villages
in our Southwest at the close of the sixteenth century.
Certain other collections of houses, to which the
word “rancherias” (ranches) was applied, were also
mentioned, the distinction between the two being
that the buildings of the latter were more widely scattered.
At present we speak of pueblo and pueblo
culture in a more exact way, and in a scientific discussion
of the origin of this culture it is necessary to
restrict the Spanish terms, or to define a pueblo from
a cultural point of view. This leads to an enumeration
of distinctive architectural features which characterize
the two types.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, giving little attention to ruins in the
country through which their route lay, confined the
term “pueblo” to inhabited towns. These early
travelers found the majority of these in a limited
area along the Rio Grande or along the Little Colorado
and in the mountains of what is now northern Arizona.
There were wide expanses of country not visited by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the Spaniards, which we now know had at that time
ruined buildings indicative of a past population, that
are similar in form to those inhabited. We find on
scientific examination evidence that the life in them
was higher in development than in the villages seen
by the explorers. Manifestly our subject must be
so treated that all pueblos, whether uninhabited or
inhabited, should be taken into account in morphological
studies. On comparison of ruined pueblos with
those inhabited in the sixteenth century certain
identities in form are revealed, but there are found also
radical differences showing degrees of culture. Indications
exist that certain arts of the later pueblos
have degenerated: the masonry is not so good and
pottery, textiles, and other manufactured articles are
inferior.</p>

<p>The accounts given by early Spanish chroniclers
afford scanty information on details of arts, and historical
documents are correspondingly imperfect.
In consideration of the subject from the point of view
of chronology, our knowledge must be derived, not
from previous histories but from archeological remains
that are fortunately very abundant through
the whole region.</p>

<p>The simplest type of pueblo building, called the
unit type, consists of one or more rectangular rooms
and a circular chamber. This form passes imperceptibly
into the linear type, a row of single rooms
united by the side of one circular room midway in
length. The linear type naturally may have single
or multiple rooms, or it may be composed of one or
more rows parallel with each other, the doorways
opening on the same side or in the same direction.
When the lines of rooms are double, and the doorways
of each row open in opposite directions, we may
designate this the double linear having external doorways.
Linear ruins may be one or more stories high;
when there is more than one story, doors or lateral
openings are generally wanting. On the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
floor, which is entered from the roof, the superimposed
rooms have lateral passageways from the roof of the
lower story.</p>

<p>A double row of buildings may be set in such a way
that the doorways face each other, or four such rows
may form a rectangle enclosing a court, which often
lacks one side. Another type has the pyramidal
form, made up of rooms crowded together with the
superimposed stories opening in all directions.</p>

<p>Wholly different in form from the various linear
types above enumerated are the circular buildings
enclosing a central court on which the doorways of
the lowest story open, and which those of the upper
stories face.</p>

<p>Pueblos both ancient and modern can be placed
in one or another of the above-mentioned types,
although in some cases two of these types may be
combined, making a composite building reaching a
considerable size. In whatever type the pueblo is
placed, the circular-form room also exists, either
enclosed in the rows or free from the rows of secular
rectangular chambers. The pyramidal, rectangular,
and linear types are comparatively modern, having
persisted to the present day, when many are inhabited;
the circular type is confined wholly to ancient times
and is no longer inhabited. Open pueblos are independent
of cliffs as distinguished from those dependent
or those built within caves. Dependent and independent
buildings are morphologically the same,
but the dependent or so-called cliff pueblos were not
inhabited at the advent of the Europeans.</p>

<p>An examination of the main features of the groups
above mentioned reveals certain common features,
an enumeration of which still further defines the
pueblo type. All have both the terraced and the
community form. They are all accompanied by a
sacred room of circular form compactly enclosed in
the mass of building or built separate from it. If we
examine the distribution geographically of the pueblo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
type, ancient and modern, we find it limited to the
area including the southern parts of Colorado, Utah,
and the greater part of New Mexico, its highest development
occurring in the mountains. It is preeminently
limited to a plateau region, and theoretically
we may suppose that it owes its peculiarities to the
characteristic physiographic conditions of this environment.
If we consider this type chronologically
we find the oldest and best examples situated in the
northern part of the area; the evidence is good that
influence from that nucleus extended west and south,
the architecture as we recede from the place of origin
becoming inferior or losing some of its essential features,
probably on account of contact with unrelated
peoples. This modification and the accompanying
departure from the type are especially marked in
extensions that came in contact with people who constructed
rooms compactly united, from southern
Arizona, where environmental conditions show a
great contrast to the mountain region in which the
pueblo originated. The plains bordering the Gila
and its tributaries are low and level, covered with a
vegetation wholly different from that of the mountain
canyons in which pueblo buildings originated. Climatically
southern Arizona is very warm throughout
the year; the mountains of Colorado are covered with
snow from November to March, inclusive. These
conditions have led in the former region to the separation
of the dwellings or a more open life of the aborigines;
the rooms are larger and not crowded together
as in pueblos; the material used in their construction
is also different; stone is not available; its absence led
to the use of clay and mud as the only materials out
of which man could construct his dwellings. Another
powerful influence created architectural modifications
in these two regions. In the mountains the village
builders were beset on all sides by hostiles or nomads
bent on plunder. It was here necessary for man to
construct his building with a view to defense by concentration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of the rooms. The level plains of southern
Arizona and the rivers with a constant flow of water
brought about irrigation along the Gila, thus making
possible a larger population. All these conditions,
reflected in the character of the buildings in the
southern region, as contrasted with the northern, have
greatly modified the culture and sociological conditions
of the aborigines of the two localities. In their
extension their boundaries met each other and their
contact has led to types of buildings with characters
of both. In one locality, Hopi, the circular kiva has
disappeared, and a rectangular room has taken its
place. Both Hopi and Zuñi pueblos have descendants
of the ancestral clans from the Gila still surviving,
and there we find the pueblo type with rectangular
kivas both enclosed in house masses and separated
from them.</p>

<p>Offshoots of the mountain or pueblo culture following
down the San Juan River penetrated to Hopi and
settled at Walpi, shortly after which they were joined
by clans from Little Colorado bringing Gila culture,
as is recounted in legends still existing. The mountain
culture introduced the terraced form of building and
the kiva free from the house masses. But this kiva
has a rectangular form due either to the configuration
of the mesa top or to influences from the south, where
the sacred room is rectangular and enclosed by dwellings.
In a case of Zuñi we have the plain type or
southern contingent predominating, the original settlement
at Zuñi having been made by clans from the
far south, which were later joined and modified by
those from the north. Here we have at the present
day the sacred room of rectangular shape hidden away
among the dwellings. This was a secondary condition
probably brought about by the influence of Catholic
missionaries, who forced the Zuñi to abandon their
sacred room in the courts of the town, and resort to
secrecy to perform the forbidden rites. Both Hopi
and Zuñi show in their architecture the influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
two component stocks or peoples, a fact more strikingly
brought out in their religious ceremonials.</p>

<p>The prehistoric center of pueblo culture origin is
situated many miles distant from the area now inhabited
by its survivals. When the Spanish travelers
first came in touch with this unique condition of life,
its center of origin was no longer inhabited. Legendary
accounts still survive in the modern pueblos
that they came from the north; our main source of
information or proof of the truth of these legends is
the character of architecture and pottery obtained
from the northern ruins, aided by what may be gathered
from the modified architecture of the inhabited
pueblos, or from historical documents.</p>

<p>It is a universal characteristic of primitive men
that the most enduring and best-constructed buildings
are those devoted to worship. We find, for instance,
throughout the Old World that the prehistoric structures
of this kind which have survived as monuments
of the past are temples, either in the form of rude
monoliths or imposing buildings, the habitations of
their builders having long since disappeared, as they
were built of perishable material and their sites can
now be detected only by low mounds.</p>

<p>Temples, however, were more lasting and work on
them was cumulative; each generation improved on its
predecessor, and as they were built of stone the additions
of successive generations were permanent, and
remained as an index of past civilization. The same
is true among prehistoric pueblos of North America.
They also erected dual buildings: one being a perishable
habitation; the other the permanent religious
building.</p>

<p>Let us consider the chronological evolution of these
two types of architecture. In the very earliest condition
the primitive people of the Southwest constructed
a massive-walled building to serve for the performance
of their rites and ceremonies. Each social group
had its own sanctuary, which we now recognize as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the kiva, commonly built in the form of towers scattered
throughout the mountainous regions of Utah
and Colorado. As is customary with similar religious
edifices, we find these, as a rule, perched on the tops
of high cliffs, not for outlooks, but for conspicuous
buildings for refuge of the neighboring population.
In ancient Greece we find the temples of Cecrops,
the ancient deity of Athens, on an Acropolis, and towering
above Corinth is the Acrocorinth. Towers
almost identical with those of Colorado occur in different
localities in Europe. We find them, for example,
in Ireland, in Spain, in Sardinia, and in Corsica,
where they have received a different name, but are
always associated with the very earliest inhabitants
of those localities. In Peru we find the problematical
<em>chulpas</em>. The function of these towers in both the
Old and the New World has been a bone of contention
among archeologists. The best explanation that has
been advanced for Old World towers is that they are
defensive and religious structures; the towers of the
New World may have had a similar use, as they are
alike in form. In other words, we may suppose that
they also are religious structures, but we can add in
support of that theory evidence not available in
Europe, for we find that, the form of the tower is identical
with that of the sacred room or kiva, and that it
has survived to the present time as a special chamber
for worship.</p>

<p>Having then determined that we can regard the
oldest form of pueblo building as a religious structure,
let us pass to the probable steps in the evolution
from this early condition into the highest development
of that strictly American type of habitation. It is
evident, if the tower be looked on as the sanctuary
of the clan, that the existence of two or more clans
united would necessitate the same number of towers,
a condition which we find repeated in the areas under
consideration. Granted that the first step in the
evolution of the pueblo would be the union of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
secular with the sacred room, this might be accomplished
either by adding the tower to the group of
dwellings, if the latter were situated in a cave, or by
moving the habitations out of the cave and annexing
them to the base of the tower. Both of these methods
seem to have been adopted, resulting on the one hand
in cliff-dwellings, and on the other in communal
buildings in the open or on top of a plateau. Subsequent
stages in the evolution of the pueblo consist
in the enlargement because of the growth of the clan
of the outlines of the dwelling clustered around the
base of the tower until subsequently contiguous groups
joined, making one village, composed of as many
clans as there are architectural units. The sacred
building lost its predominance in this enlargement,
and the tower passed without morphological changes
into the kiva. We can trace all these modifications
in the canyons and plateaus of southwestern Colorado.</p>

<p>Sociological advance goes hand in hand with architectural
complication. In the beginning the number of
social units is indicated by the number of kivas; the
next stage is the diminution in relative number of sacred
rooms and other changes which appear in the relative
size of the kivas. The several social units brought in
such intimate contact naturally evolved a system of
worship reflecting that union. This appears most
clearly in the formation of a fraternity of priests to
perform the ceremony resulting from consolidation,
which leads to the abandonment of kivas rendered
unnecessary, or to the fusion of several into one, and
the enlargement of those remaining to accommodate the
fraternity composed of men of several social units.
This enlargement is shown at Far View House, a
pueblo lately excavated in the Mesa Verde National
Park, Colorado. The total population of this pueblo
was probably as large as that of Cliff Palace, but
whereas in this cliff dwelling we find twenty-three
sacred rooms, in Far View House there are but four,
one of which (the central) is four times as large as any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
in Cliff Palace. It is easy to see why the central kiva
in the pueblo is more centrally placed than the others,
when we remember that it was probably the oldest,
and was the first settled, and in subsequent growth
of the village remained the predominant one of the
group.</p>

<p>Following the lines of social evolution and architectural
types considered in the preceding pages, we
come now to a classification of buildings in the Southwest.
Passing over the earliest expression of architecture,
where a hut or dugout shows few peculiar
features but practically is universal among a seminomadic
people, we come to durable houses built of
clay or stone. Even in these small buildings we recognize
two types of rooms—circular and rectangular.
We find two distinct types of village communities, one
occupying the area extending from Utah to the inhabited
pueblos on the Rio Grande. This group may be
known in prehistoric culture by circular ruins and
circular kivas. Here probably arose the original
terraced form of building. The purest expression of
its architecture occurs in cliff-dwellings like Cliff
Palace and Spruce-tree House in the Mesa Verde
National Park, but its extensions west and south are
modified as the distance from the place of origin
increases.</p>

<p>The second type of buildings in the Southwest arose
in the Gila valley, and is best illustrated by Casa
Grande in southern Arizona. From this nucleus
extensions of architectural forms were carried northward
and eastward to the pueblos now inhabited by
Hopi and Zuñi Indians. A characteristic feature of
this type is the massive-walled buildings surrounded
by a rectangular wall or compound. The circular
kiva and circular ruin do not exist in present forms of
this type. Ruins in southern Arizona, belonging to
this type, often have very much modified forms,
especially as the type extended northward and came
in contact with extensions of the pueblo culture.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Architectural characters and other features of this
type show marked affinities with the corresponding
culture of prehistoric peoples of Mexico.</p>

<p>The mythology and ritual of the people in this area
are more closely related to Mexican than to northern
or pueblo culture. This may be illustrated by many
examples, of which one instance may be taken. One
of the most marked peculiarities of the prehistoric
culture in this zone is the elaborate worship of a supernatural
being called the Horned Serpent.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
Horned Serpent cult was introduced into Hopiland
from the Gila and is associated with the sky-god, whose
symbol is the sun. Evidences of the widespread influence
of this cult in prehistoric times is shown by
figures of this being found on pottery all the way from
Hopi to the Mexican plateau. Among the Maya
and Aztec, when Horned Snake worship was perhaps
the most complicated anywhere in pre-Columbian
America, it was, as it is at Hopi, intimately associated
with sun-worship. The Horned and Plumed
Serpent figures adorn many prehistoric buildings of
Mexico, and occur in all the codices of the Maya.
Here we have the symbol not originally regarded as
serpents. Kukulcan, or Quetzalcoatl, were but beneficent
beings who taught the ancients agriculture and
other arts, but whose benign presence was banished
through the machinations of a sorcerer. The striking
similarities in the objective symbolism of the Plumed
Serpent of Mexican mythology and the Hopi Horned
Serpent have been shown elsewhere; the ceremonies
in which his effigy is used in the Hopi ritual are practically
connected with sun-worship, and were introduced
from the south. Wherever the influence of the
architectural type above considered is detected we
find evidences of Horned Serpent cult.</p>

<p>The most important rite at Walpi in which idols of
this being are used occurs at the winter solstice and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
the vernal equinox, and are always connected with a
highly developed sun-worship. These appear as
effigies, which in one ceremonial drama are carried
by a being personating the sun; in other dramatic rites
they are thrust through openings in a screen on which
sun emblems are painted. An idol of the Horned
Serpent, made of the giant cactus, a plant abundant
in the Gila valley, is carried by the chief of the Sun
priests’ ceremony celebrated in midwinter. Numerous
other examples of the association of the sun and
the Horned Serpent in the solar worship of the Hopi
have been elsewhere described and might be mentioned
to prove that the religious conception back of the
Horned Serpent cult is the symbolical representation
of a nature power of the sky or the sun. The conception
typified by the Horned Snake cult of the Hopi
and that of the Plumed Snake of Mexico is the same;
that symbols of this being occur on prehistoric objects
found in the region stretching from the Hopi country
far into Central America cannot be questioned.
Whether one was derived from the other or both were
independently evolved is another question.</p>

<p>The ancient people of the pueblo type widespread
throughout New Mexico and Colorado likewise used
in their ceremonials a Plumed Serpent symbol, which
has been identified as the Great Horned Snake. The
cult of this being is also associated with sun-worship,
but as the little we know of the symbolism of this
being is derived from the winter solstice ceremony at
the Tewa pueblo Hano and a few pictographs or
paintings on Tewa pottery, it is not possible to hazard
a conjecture regarding its teaching on culture derivation.
The evidence, so far as it goes, supports the
theory that a Sun Serpent cult like that of ancient
Mexico exists in our Southwest today in a much more
primitive form.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> In the Snake Dances of the pueblo region, we have more striking evidence of ancestor
worship. The ceremonials in which the Horned Snake idols appear show a
more elaborate sun-worship.</p>
